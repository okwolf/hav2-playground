# Hyperapp v2 playground

A set of demo apps using the latest alpha code for the [`hyperapp/hyperapp#V2`](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp/tree/V2) and [`hyperapp/fx#HAv2`](https://github.com/hyperapp/fx/tree/HAv2) branches using [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). Useful for Hyperapp and FX/sub dev since it allows for rapid iteration and testing of changes to these libraries while allowing for commiting to the library repos directly.

## Usage

```console
npm start
```
